Identify the main topic of the article from the following list and return it as the field "topic": politics, economy, health, technology, culture, sports, environment, crime, international, education, other.

Based on the article, identify any applicable framing categories used to present the topic. Choose from: crisis, conflict, human_interest, responsibility, morality, solution, economic_consequences, security, none. Return them as an array in the field "frames_detected".

Return your analysis as a valid JSON object with ALL the following fields, even if some values are zero, empty, or not applicable. Do NOT omit any field. Use the exact structure and field names below:
